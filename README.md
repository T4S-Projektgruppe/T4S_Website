### What is Teamup4Success?
Teamup4Success, or T4S, is a system used in our school to give students the opportunity for private tutoring by other students. It got deployed, because for our technical subjects, you will not find many private tutors which do not have any connection to our school. So this program got deployed, because the students currently visiting are closer to the subjects than any private tutor from outside the school.

### The reason for this project
The reason why we decided to develop a webapp for T4S was, that whenever someone needed help, he would need to look at a list handed out to every class and choose someone whom he would ask to help him.  But what, if the student is at home due to an illness and has no chance to look at the list? Also, the members of this project only have one chance to volunteer in the first two weeks. With the webapp, everyone from within the school can volunteer anytime to give private tutoring to other students.
